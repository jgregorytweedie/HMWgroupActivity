This project initialy only had one css file. My plan was to structure the HTML in a way that I can use the same/similar structure for all/most of the pages. For this, I considered a lot of styles as 'utilities' and decided to keep them common for multiple pages. 

For example, 'container' is a class name that I used to nest content to keep centering consistent in all pages. There are several other such examples. I believe this would have been helpful if I kept all my css in one file. But I decided to make seperate files for css, and in the process of doing that, the common, utility classes are kept in the main css file. Therefore, other pages that uses the utility classes also had to be linked to the main css file. 

The section with id of 'text-content' is another such commanly used element. It is used to house the long form text in the home page, the employee cards in the contact page, the image gallery, and the forms. Again, the idea was to create an html page that can be reused for several pages fo the project. 

The css for the 'register' page will look extremely short, becase that page's main content - the form is styled original in 'contact'. The form was further developed for the login page, and basically recycled for the register page.
